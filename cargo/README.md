## 4.9.1 CARGO
Each CARGO is an orange 13-in. (~33 cm) rubber playground ball with a FIRST logo as shown in Figure
4-29. The ball is made by Sportime (PN 1623139E) and sold by AndyMark ([PN am-4000_cargo](http://www.andymark.com/2019cargo)). The
closest commercially available substitute, a red ball with no FIRST logo (same size and material), is
available at School Specialty (Sportime PN [1293618](https://www.schoolspecialty.com/playground-ball-1293618)).

>These playground balls used as CARGO are not manufactured with any tight tolerance.
Theyâ€™re not balanced all the way around and wall thickness varies so they may not
always roll straight or bounce as expected.
